# SIS-2 Order Tracker

Welcome to the repository of **SIS-2 Order Tracker**, a modern web application built leveraging the power of cutting-edge technologies to deliver a robust, scalable, and intuitive user experience.

At the heart of our application lies Laravel 11, the latest and most advanced version of the popular PHP framework. Known for its elegant syntax and rich features, Laravel 11 provides a solid foundation for our application, ensuring a streamlined development process and adherence to the best coding practices.

To complement our backend, we employ MySQL as our relational database management system. MySQL's reliability and performance make it a perfect fit for handling the complex data operations required by our application.

On the frontend, we utilize Bootstrap, the world's most popular front-end open-source toolkit. Bootstrap's responsive grid system and pre-designed components allow us to create a visually appealing and highly interactive user interface that adapts seamlessly across all devices.

Our application is designed to run on the newest PHP version, ensuring top-notch security, speed, and efficiency. By staying up-to-date with the latest PHP features, we can guarantee that our application is leveraging the full potential of the language.

This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources needed to deploy and run the application. Whether you're a contributor or simply interested in exploring the capabilities of our project, we've provided detailed instructions to help you get started with ease.

## Technical solutions
- MVC laravel principles. System use Model Objects to manipulate data in data layer, Controller objects are used to make logical operations with requests, Views responsible for front-end part.
- Front-end is made using bootstrap framework.
